fizz buzz test with lambda functions

The fizz buzz tests is aimed to check if you know how to write a function.
In the fizz buzz test you are asked write a function that says 'fizz' when
a number is a multiple of x, and 'buzz' when it is a multiple of y.

In this case, the test uses lambda functions to evaluate the input integers.
    # A lambda function is a quick way to evaluate an operation.
    # A simple form can be: (lambda x: do something with x) (put x here)

For an example with regular functions, see fizzBuzz_normal.py
You may find useful documentations at the bottom.

################################## Start program ##################################

# First, create a variable with input from user, aka standard input (stdin):
number = input("Tell me your integer and I\'ll fizz or buzz: ")

# Now, define the function which will evaluate the number in our variable:

def fizzbuzz(int:number): # int means the variable must be an integer

    either = 0 # this switch will help us keep track of fizz and/or buzz

    # We will use the modulo operator '%', which renders the reminder of a division.
    if (lambda x: ((x%5)+(x%7)) == 0) (number): # if the sum of both modulos is 0:
        print("fizz-buzz")

    # If the sum is not 0, then maybe one of them is 0
    else:
        if (lambda x: (x%5) == 0) (number): # check if the reminder of number /5 is 0
            print("fizz")
            either += 1 # we have found a fizz, so add +1
        if (lambda x: (x%7) == 0) (number):
            print("buzz")
            either += 1 # we have found a fizz, so add +1

    # If we did not see a fizz or buzz, then tell the user:
        if not either: # 'not' will evaluate 'true' if 'either' is empty or zero:
            print("neither fizz nor buzz")


################################## Loop ##################################

# While loops keep happening as long as their condition is true:
while number.isnumeric(): # .isnumeric() is a string method to check for numbers
    # we will convert the number to an integer
    number = int(number)
    # we will pass the number to our fizzbuzz function above
    fizzbuzz(number)
    # We will ask the user for another number.
    # If the user types anything other than a number, the while loop will stop.
    number = input("\nTell me your integer and I\'ll fizz or buzz or exit with enter: ")
